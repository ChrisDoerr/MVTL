MVTL - The Meomundo Vertical Timeline (experimental)

A very simple HTML/CSS timeline.
Not very flexible but very small because of that.

{ROW} [year] [visual timeline + data point] [entries]

GRID seems to be the better, cleaner approach.
The only "smell" is that ROWS are not represented
as such kind of a structure in the HTML code.
This -feels- wrong but maybe it is not.
